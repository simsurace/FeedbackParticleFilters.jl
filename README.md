This package's aim is to provide a versatile and efficient feedback particle filter implementation in Julia, with abstractions to flexibly construct, run, and analyze feedback particle filters for a variety of uni- and multivariate filtering problems with both diffusion and point process observations.

It provides implementations of the following algorithms:
- Kalman-Bucy filter `KBF`
- Feedback Particle Filter `FPF`
- Bootstrap Particle Filter (weighted) `BPF`
- Point-process Feedback Particle Filter `ppFPF`
- Ensemble Kushner-Stratonovich-Poisson Filter `EKSPF`

as well as
* Hidden state and observation models: diffusions, Poisson processes, etc.
* A variety of gain estimation methods: constant gain, semigroup, reproducing kernel Hilbert space, etc.
* Deterministic particle flow

## Installation

This package is officially registered.
To install it, use the built-in package manager:

```julia
pkg> add FeedbackParticleFilters
```
The package is currently tested on Julia 1.6-1.8, but should work on earlier versions too.

## Usage

To load the package, use the command:
```julia
using FeedbackParticleFilters
```
Set up a basic one-dimensional linear-Gaussian continuous-time filtering problem:
```julia
using Distributions
state_model = ScalarDiffusionStateModel(x->-x, x->sqrt(2.), Normal())
obs_model   = ScalarDiffusionObservationModel(x->x)

filt_prob   = FilteringProblem(state_model, obs_model)
```
Once the filtering problem is defined, an appropriate filtering algorithm can be defined like this:
```julia
method = ConstantGainApproximation()
filter = FPF(filt_prob, method, 100)
```
The package comes with methods to automatically simulate a given system:
```julia
simulation = ContinuousTimeSimulation(filt_prob, filter, 10000, 0.01)
run!(simulation)
```
